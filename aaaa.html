        <p>The foundation started 14 years ago… the original owner <strong>Lolo Tomas</strong>, has given a post for change in the family and decided to hand over his small business to <strong>Kulet</strong>, in which he is expected to continue the line of story.

            Time has passed and the business later gets known as <strong>Sisig Ni Kulet</strong> and has been popular amongst its neighbourhood for its amount of serving and friendly service towards its customers…
            
            As of today, the eldest of sons has taken its step through business and has decided to take the temporary name <strong>Siomai Ni Negative Zero</strong> as a step to achieving the greatest of his goals.
            
            And so on, the legacy continues itself, from this day onwards achieving the desired goals greater and greater as days pass by.</p><br>
        <p><strong>Siomai</strong> (Filipino: siyomay) in the Philippines is often ground pork, beef, shrimp, and the like. It is combined with extenders like garlic, green peas, carrots and among others which is then wrapped in wonton wrappers. It is commonly steamed, with a popular variant being fried, resulting in a crisp exterior. It is normally dipped in soy sauce with the juice of calamansi, a Philippine lime, and a chili-garlic oil is sometimes added to the sauce.</p><br>

        <p> recent variant on siomai is wrapped in sheets of laver after the wonton wrappers, which are marketed as <strong>"Japanese"</strong>.</p>
